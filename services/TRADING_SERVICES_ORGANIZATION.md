```

## Migration Plan

### **Phase 1: Reorganization (Current)**
- [x] Create new directory structure
- [x] Move existing services to appropriate directories (mock engine, recommendations, portfolio)
- [x] Update import paths and references (initial pass)
- [x] Update Docker Compose configurations (added portfolio service)

### **Phase 2: Service Extraction (Week 1-2)**
- [x] Extract portfolio management from trading engines (fallback removed)
- [x] Create dedicated risk management service (enhanced exposure checks)
- [x] Implement signal processing service (basic recent signals endpoint)
- [ ] Add analytics service framework

### **Phase 3: Advanced Services (Week 3-4)**
- [ ] Live trading engine implementation
- [ ] Advanced risk management features
- [ ] Comprehensive analytics dashboard
- [ ] Performance optimization

## Benefits of New Organization

### **1. Separation of Concerns**
- Each service has a single, well-defined responsibility
- Easier to maintain and debug individual components
- Independent scaling of different service types

### **2. Scalability**
- Services can be deployed independently
- Resource allocation based on service requirements
- Horizontal scaling of high-demand services

### **3. Development Efficiency**
- Clear ownership and boundaries for each service
- Easier onboarding for new developers
- Reduced code duplication

### **4. Operational Excellence**
- Independent monitoring and alerting per service
- Granular health checks and metrics
- Easier troubleshooting and debugging

### **5. Future Expansion**
- Clear patterns for adding new trading services
- Standardized interfaces between services
- Plugin architecture for strategy extensions

## Implementation Steps

### **Immediate Actions (Completed)**
1. **Move Existing Services**
   ```bash
   # Move mock trading engine
   mv backend/services/trading_engine/* backend/services/trading/engines/
   
   # Move recommendation service  
   mv backend/services/trading_recommendation_engine/* backend/services/trading/recommendations/
   ```

2. **Update Docker Configurations**
   - Update build contexts in docker-compose.trading.yml
   - Maintain existing port assignments (8021, 8022)
   - Update health check paths

3. **Update Documentation**
   - Update all service paths in documentation
   - Revise port allocation tables
   - Update developer guides

### **Next Phase Actions (Updated)**
1. **Advanced Risk Enhancements**
   - Add VaR & volatility-based limits
   - Persist risk counters to DB
2. **Signals Expansion**
   - Integrate ML signal processor & quality metrics
3. **Analytics Service**
   - Performance & attribution endpoints
4. **Auth & Observability Hardening**
   - API key rotation + per-service scopes
   - Structured logging & tracing (OTel)
5. **Data Consistency**
   - Remove legacy `status` column (post-migration) in favor of `execution_status`
6. **Testing & CI**
   - Expand integration test coverage & add CI pipeline

## File Movement Mapping

trading_engine/improved_live_trading_engine.py â†’ trading/engines/live_trading_engine.py

trading_recommendation_engine/trade_recommendation_service.py â†’ trading/recommendations/recommendation_service.py
trading_recommendation_engine/create_crypto_transactions_schema.py â†’ trading/shared/database_schemas.py
```

### **Docker Configuration Updates**
```yaml
# New docker-compose.trading.yml structure
services:
  mock-trading-engine:
    build:
      context: ./trading/engines
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.mock-trading
    
  trade-recommendations:
    build:
      context: ./trading/recommendations  
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.trade-recommendations
```

## Cross-Cutting Features Implemented

- Unified API Key auth (`X-TRADING-API-KEY`) across active services
- Prometheus-compatible `/metrics` endpoints (engine, recommendations, portfolio, risk, signals)
- Execution status unification: `status` kept for backward compatibility; `execution_status` authoritative
- Enhanced risk evaluation (allocation%, symbol exposure%, daily trade cap)
- Dockerized risk & signals services (new Dockerfiles + requirements)
- Initial integration test scaffold (auth, metrics, risk rejection)

This organization provides a solid foundation for scaling the trading system while maintaining clear boundaries between different types of trading services.

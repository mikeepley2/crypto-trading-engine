# Trade Execution Issues Analysis

## Issues Identified and Status

### ‚úÖ **FIXED: Symbol Mapping**
- **Problem**: Trade executor looking for "ETH" but account has "ETH2" (staked Ethereum)
- **Solution**: Added symbol mapping in trade executor configuration
- **Result**: `Found variation match: ETH2 for ETH (tried ETH2)` ‚úÖ
- **Status**: RESOLVED

### üîç **INVESTIGATING: ETH2 Trade Execution**
- **Problem**: Symbol mapping works, but trade execution stops after finding ETH2 account
- **Possible Causes**:
  1. ETH2 (staked Ethereum) may not be tradeable on Coinbase Advanced Trade
  2. Balance parsing issues with ETH2 account
  3. API restrictions on staked assets
- **Status**: UNDER INVESTIGATION

### üîç **INVESTIGATING: BTC Trade Failures**
- **Problem**: No BTC account found in available symbols
- **Root Cause**: Account has no BTC holdings
- **Status**: VALID - No BTC to trade

### üîç **INVESTIGATING: LINK Trade Failures**
- **Problem**: Account found, balance shown (0.01847212), but fails with "UNKNOWN_FAILURE_REASON"
- **Possible Causes**:
  1. Insufficient balance for minimum trade size
  2. Precision issues with small amounts
  3. Coinbase API restrictions
- **Status**: UNDER INVESTIGATION

### üîç **INVESTIGATING: DOT Trade Failures**
- **Problem**: Account found, but execution stops
- **Possible Causes**:
  1. Balance parsing issues
  2. Trade execution logic problems
- **Status**: UNDER INVESTIGATION

## Improvements Made

### 1. **Enhanced Error Logging**
- Added detailed balance parsing logs
- Added account processing logs
- Added error message logging for failed trades
- Added balance type and value logging

### 2. **Symbol Mapping**
- Added comprehensive symbol mapping for common variations
- ETH ‚Üí ETH2 mapping for staked Ethereum
- Case-insensitive matching
- Multiple variation attempts

### 3. **Intelligent Controls**
- Daily trade limits working (ADA shows "LIMIT_EXCEEDED")
- Duplicate detection working
- Trade cooldown periods

## Next Steps

1. **Wait for trade executor to finish starting up**
2. **Test with improved error logging to identify specific failure points**
3. **Investigate ETH2 tradeability on Coinbase Advanced Trade**
4. **Check minimum trade sizes and precision requirements**
5. **Verify balance parsing for different account types**

## Current Pipeline Status

- ‚úÖ Signal Generation: Working (generating SELL signals)
- ‚úÖ Signal to Recommendation: Working (10+ recommendations created)
- ‚úÖ Trade Orchestrator: Working (processing recommendations)
- ‚úÖ Intelligent Controls: Working (limits, duplicates, cooldowns)
- üîç Trade Execution: Investigating specific failure reasons
- ‚ùå LLM Validation: Not running (all show "None")

## Recommendations

1. **Focus on symbols with actual holdings** (ADA, LINK, DOT)
2. **Investigate ETH2 tradeability** - may need to skip staked assets
3. **Check minimum trade sizes** for each cryptocurrency
4. **Implement proper error recording** throughout the pipeline
5. **Consider adding balance validation** before attempting trades
